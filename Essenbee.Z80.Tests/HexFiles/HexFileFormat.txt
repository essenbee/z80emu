:LLAAAATT[DD ...]CC

:    = start of line
LL   = number of DD data bytes in record
AAAA = start address
TT   = record type:
		00 = data
		01 = end-of-file
		02 = extended segment address record
		04 = extended linear address record
		05 = start linear address record
DD   = data byte (there will be LL of these in the record)
CC   = checksum
