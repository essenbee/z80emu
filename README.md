Building a Z80 emulator in C# 7.3 as a .NET Standard 2.0 Class Library using the Test Driven Development (TDD) mindset. The aim is to create an accurate emulation of the Z80 CPU as a nuget package for general use. We will then go on to use the emulated CPU in a larger project to emulate a particular machine, maybe a ZX Spectrum or an Amstrad CPC or similar (not decided yet). Development will happen both on and off my Twitch live-coding stream, https://twitch.tv/codebasealpha.

Known as Project Z, coverage of this project begins from Episode 66. Use the link above to follow me on Twitch and be notifed when I am streaming (normally twice a week on Mondays and Wednesdays, but I sometimes run unscheduled pop-up streams).

## Sample Project

The included project *Essenbee.Spectrum48* is an example implementation using the Z80 emulator. It is a very simple and currently quite limited emulation of a ZX Spectrum 48K. It is possible to program in BASIC using this emulation. Who knows how sophisticated (or not) it might become over time? If you would like to contribute code for the sample (or any other project), **why not submit a Pull Request?**
