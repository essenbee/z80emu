# z80emu

![Workflow](https://github.com/essenbee/z80emu/workflows/.NET%20Core/badge.svg)

Building a Z80 emulator in C# 8.0 as a .NET Standard 2.1 Class Library using the Test Driven Development (TDD) mindset. The aim is to create an accurate emulation of the Z80 CPU as a nuget package for general use. We will then go on to use the emulated CPU in a larger project to emulate a particular machine, maybe an Amstrad CPC or similar (not decided yet). Development will happen both on and off my Twitch live-coding stream, https://twitch.tv/codebasealpha.

Known as Project Z, coverage of this project begins from Episode 66.
